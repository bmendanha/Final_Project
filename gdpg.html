 <h1>Data Protection</h1> 
<h2> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
     
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets rules for the collection and processing of personal information of individuals within the European Union (EU). The GDPR sets out the principles for data management and the rights of the individual, while also imposing fines that can be revenue-based. GDPR came into effect across the EU on May 25, 2018.</p>

    <p>GDPR applies to personal data which   "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”. For more information on this, please visit <a href="https://eugdpr.org/" target="_blank"><strong>EU GDPR.ORG</strong></a></p>

    <p> Bruno Mendanha&copy is GDPR ready. We have done what is necessary to meet the legal and contractual requirements of GDPR as it stands today. We will closely follow how the interpretation of GDPR will evolve and make changes as deemed necessary.</p>

    <p>In pursuit of GDPR's requirements for EU Minors, Bruno Mendanha&copy has made changes to some policies. EU Minors for the purposes of GDPR are those children who are in Europe and are less than 16 years of age. Minors require a Parental/Guardian consent to access any online resources.</p>
